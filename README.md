### How to use:
#

#### Spacing
To anyone who's used BootStrap before, this is exactly the same. Sizes range between 1-6, and are given in rems.
`.m-1`-->`margin: 1rem;`  
`.mt-3`-->`margin-top: 3rem;`  
`.ml-5`-->`margin-left: 4rem;`  

###### The same with padding:
`.p-1`-->`padding: 1rem;`  
`.pr-6`-->`padding-right: 6rem;`  

#### Fonts
  Fonts come in sizes raging from xs to xl, along with h-sized fonts that range bewtween 1 and 6. Font weights are also inncluded.

`.h1`-->`font-size: 4.8rem;`
`.h6`-->`font-size: 2.3rem;`  

`.fs-lg`-->`font-size: 2.0rem;`  
`.fs-md`-->`{font-size: 1.6rem;`  
`.fs-sm`-->`font-size: 1.2rem;`  
`.fs-xs`-->`font-size: 0.8rem;`  

`.fw-heavy`-->`font-weight: 700;`  
`.fw-light`-->`font-weight: 300;`  

  #### Display Properties
The display properties are here to easily apply flex-styles to individual elements.

`.flex-row` has the following properties:
  ```{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```
`.flex-col-reverse` You may have guessed.
```
{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
```
`.justify-conter`-->`justify-content: center;`
`.space-around`-->`justify-content: space-around;`

#### Bonus:
###### Included in every BOOM CSS link is a free CSS style reset. You're welcome.
